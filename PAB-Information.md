## Snackapalooza

Hi OMS parents,

The first Snack-a-palooza of the year will take place on Thursday, September 8 around 5pm. Come meet other OMS parents, students, and their siblings (and maybe even the teachers) to celebrate the start of the new school year.

For those of you who are new to OMS, Snack-a-palooza started before my kids enrolled at OMS and we've kept up the tradition. The kids love it.

So, what is Snack-a-palooza?
Each family brings their kid's favorite snack to share with the other kids. 
Bring enough to feed ~15-20 kiddos + parents
If your snack is not individually packaged, bring something to scoop/grab it + something for the kids to put it in (small paper cups work well)
The kids are likely to spoil their dinners :)
We'll meet at the Dimond Park picnic tables next to the tennis courts. If they are reserved, we'll migrate to the picnic tables near the playground.

If you have questions, please reach out to Billy Rusteen via email (william.rusteen@outlook.com).

Looking forward to seeing you all there next week.

In the meantime, have a great Labor Day weekend!

OMS PAB
